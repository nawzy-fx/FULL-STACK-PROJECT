    <h2>Football</h2>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">Football is a fast-paced and globally popular sport. I enjoy the excitement of the matches, the strategies involved, and the passion fans bring to the game.</p>

    <h2>Cricket</h2>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">Cricket is a sport rich in tradition and skill. I love watching test matches for their strategic depth and T20 games for their high energy and entertainment.</p>

    <h2>Rugby</h2>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">Rugby is a physically demanding sport that requires strength, teamwork, and resilience. I admire the spirit of the game and the respect players show each other.</p>
