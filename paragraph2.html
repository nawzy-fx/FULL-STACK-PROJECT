    <h2>Football</h2>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">
        Football is a fast-paced and exciting sport.<br>
        I enjoy the thrill of goals, teamwork, and international tournaments.<br>
        Watching the World Cup is one of my favorite events.

    <h2>Cricket</h2>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">
        Cricket has a unique charm with its different formats.<br>
        Test matches are strategic and slow-paced,<br>
        while T20 games are short and full of energy.

    <h2>Rugby</h2>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">
        Rugby is a game of strength, speed, and skill.<br>
        The physical intensity and respect between teams make it exciting to watch.<br>
        It's a great example of sportsmanship.
